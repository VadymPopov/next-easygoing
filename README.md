# EasyGoing

Welcome to EasyGoing, your go-to web application for making daily decisions easier! In today's fast-paced world, we are often overloaded with choices and sometimes struggle to decide what to do. EasyGoing is here to help you with that.

## Overview

EasyGoing consists of three main pages: Listo, Nums, and Netflix&Chill. Each page serves a different purpose but shares the common goal of helping you make decisions effortlessly.

### Listo

Listo is where you can write down your options when you're faced with a decision. Whether it's choosing what to eat for dinner, which movie to watch, or where to go on vacation, Listo allows you to jot down all your choices. Then, the Oracle, inspired by The Matrix movie theme, will randomly pick one for you. Let the Oracle guide your decision-making process!

### Nums

Similar to Listo, Nums helps you make decisions by selecting a random number from a specified range. Whether you're deciding how many chapters to read, how many minutes to spend exercising, or anything else that requires a numerical choice, Nums has got you covered. Simply set the range, and let the Oracle choose a number for you.

### Netflix&Chill

Are you tired of the classic back-and-forth of "What should we watch tonight?" "I don't know, what do you want?" Netflix&Chill is here to rescue you from that dilemma. This page offers two options:

1. **Random Movie by Genre and Year:** Let the Oracle randomly select a movie for you based on the chosen genre and year.
2. **Random Top Rated Movie:** Alternatively, you can opt for the Oracle to pick a top-rated movie at random.

With Netflix&Chill, you can spend less time deciding and more time enjoying your movie night.
